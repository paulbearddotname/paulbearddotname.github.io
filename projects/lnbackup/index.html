<p>lnbackup is a backup program capable of creating backup directories that mirror the source without duplicating unmodified files.</p>

<p>Each run results in a new backup directory named with the date and time the backup started.
Each backup directory is a complete mirror of the source.
Unmodified backup files are hard linked.
New backup files are created as copy-on-write duplicates of source files if possible.
Files are also indexed by hash to identify moved, renamed, and duplicate files.</p>
